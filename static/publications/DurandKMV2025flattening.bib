    abstract  = {We propose a systematic study of the so-called flattening operator in team semantics. This operator was first introduced by Hodges in 1997, and has not been studied in more detail since. We begin a systematic study of the expressive power this operator adds to the most well-known team-based logics, such as dependence logic, anonymity logic, inclusion logic and exclusion logic.},
